    <h1>How to Make Naan</h1>
    <p>Making delightfully soft homemade naan is easier than you think.
        You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, 
        but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe:</p>
    <p>Start by making an easy egg-enriched yeast dough, then let it rise for one hour. 
        Next, punch the dough down and knead in minced garlic or other desired fillings before letting it rise a second time. 
        Cook the naan dough on a grill pan over high heat until golden brown and puffy.</p>
